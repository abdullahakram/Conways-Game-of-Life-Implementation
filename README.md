# Implementation of Conway's Game of Life Implementation

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton invented by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It consists of a grid of cells, where each cell can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The cells evolve over time according to a set of rules that determine whether a cell will be alive or dead in the next generation.

The rules are based on the number of live neighbors around each cell. If a cell has fewer than two live neighbors or more than three live neighbors, it dies from loneliness or overcrowding, respectively. If a dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, it becomes alive due to reproduction. Otherwise, a live cell with two or three live neighbors survives to the next generation.

The initial state of the grid can be set by the user or generated randomly. The Game of Life is interesting because it exhibits complex behaviors and patterns that emerge from simple rules. These patterns include oscillators that repeat themselves periodically, spaceships that move across the grid, and glider guns that continuously generate spaceships. The Game of Life has applications in various fields such as biology, physics, and computer science.

In this implementation, we use the NumPy library to create a 2D grid of size N by N. We randomly initialize the grid with a 50/50 chance of each cell being alive or dead. We then define a function update that takes the current grid as input and returns the updated grid according to the rules of the Game of Life. The function counts the number of live neighbors for each cell and applies the rules to update the cell state. Finally, the function updates the grid and the image object that we use to display the animation.

We create the animation using the matplotlib.animation module, which repeatedly calls the update function to update the grid and the image. We specify the number of frames and the interval between frames, and set the blit parameter to True to improve the animation performance. Finally, we show the animation using plt.show().
